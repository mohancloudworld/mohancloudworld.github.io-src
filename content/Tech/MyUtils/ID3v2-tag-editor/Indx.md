Title: ID3v2-tag-editor

* ID3v2-tag-editor is a command line editor for Id3v2 metadata for audio (MP3) files 
* Supported versions: Id3v2.3 and Id3v2.4
* It has two modes of operation (a) Command-line mode (b) Interactive mode
* Supported frames for reading: Text info frames, URL link frames, APIC, PCNT, POPM, USLT, GEOB, MCDI, COMM, USER
* Supported frames for writing: artist, album, title, comments, genre, year, track no, album-art (attached-picture) 
* Deletion of frames: 
    (a) Can delete all frames at once. 
    (b) In 'Interactive-mode', can delete individual frames (only that are supported for 'writing')
* Supported flags: 'Unsynchronisation', 'Data length indicator'
* While writing album-art info (APIC frame), image is re-sized to (640,960), to save space
* Multiple (two) levels of verbosity is supported
* In verbose (-vv) mode, to display frames with binary data (APIC, GEOB, MCDI), the data is written into files in local directory. In all other modes, binary data is skipped.
* Most of the user input is parsed as unicode-data, so user can feed information in multiple languages
* The usage is compatible with "id3v2" linux utility

## **Known Issues:**

* While modifying a frame, skips writing all other similar frames into output file
(It should skip frames with same 'Content type' only)
* Repetition of frames while reading/writing is not checked 
* 'Data length indicator' flag is not used while writing frames 
* writing and deleting of frames is limited to only few types of frames 
* Other frames & flags need to be implemented

## **Usage:**

usage: id3v2-tag-editor.py [-h] [-v] [-D] [-l] [-t TITLE] [-A ALBUM]
